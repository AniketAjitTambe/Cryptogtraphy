# End to End Encryption between Client to Client interaction through Server using combination of asymmetric and symmetric key encryption

##  Aim
Implement end to end encryption for client to client communication through server using Cryptography(Combination of Asymmetric and Symmetric Encryption).

##  Objective
In this project, two clients:  client 0 and client 1 communicate with each other in the form of messages. Both clients are connected to a server, which handles the client and message transfer between the two messages. Due to this, all the interactions are visible and readable on serverâ€™s log. 
Thus, the objective of his project is to make the interaction between the two clients end to end encrypted in such a way that the messages are encrypted with a secret key. This secret key is jointly formed and agreed upon by both clients and exchanged with each other in an encrypted format.
